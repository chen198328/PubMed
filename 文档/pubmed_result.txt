AB  - BACKGROUND: Cortidis rhizoma (Huanglian) and its major therapeutic component,
      berberine, have drawn extensive attention in recent years for their anti-cancer
      properties. Growth inhibitory effects of berberine on multiple types of human
      cancer cells have been reported. Berberine inhibits invasion, induces cell cycle 
      arrest and apoptosis in human cancer cells. The anti-inflammatory property of
      berberine, involving inhibition of Signal Transducer and Activator of
      Transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, has also been documented. METHODS: In this
      study, we have examined the effects of berberine on tumorigenicity and growth of 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells and their relationship to STAT3 signaling
      using both in vivo and in vitro models. RESULTS: Berberine effectively inhibited 
      the tumorigenicity and growth of an EBV-positive NPC cell line (C666-1) in
      athymic nude mice. Inhibition of tumorigenic growth of NPC cells in vivo was
      correlated with effective inhibition of STAT3 activation in NPC cells inside the 
      tumor xenografts grown in nude mice. In vitro, berberine inhibited both
      constitutive and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in NPC cells. Inhibition of STAT3 
      activation by berberine induced growth inhibition and apoptotic response in NPC
      cells. Tumor-associated fibroblasts were found to secret IL-6 and the conditioned
      medium harvested from the fibroblasts also induced STAT3 activation in NPC cells.
      Furthermore, STAT3 activation by conditioned medium of tumor-associated
      fibroblasts could be blocked by berberine or antibodies against IL-6 and IL-6R.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our observation that berberine effectively inhibited activation of
      STAT3 induced by tumor-associated fibroblasts suggests a role of berberine in
      modulating the effects of tumor stroma on the growth of NPC cells. The effective 
      inhibition of STAT3 activation in NPC cells by berberine supports its potential
      use in the treatment of NPC.
